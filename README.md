# Airbnb Data Analysis for Pricing and Occupancy Insights 
Welcome to the Airbnb Analysis project! This project focuses on analyzing Airbnb data to gain valuable insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the travel and property management domain. We use Python scripting, data preprocessing, and Power BI for data visualization to explore the data.

# Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

**Data Retrieval**: Retrieve the Airbnb dataset efficiently.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and prepare the dataset by addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

**Price Analysis and Visualization**: Analyze and visualize pricing variations based on location and property type using Power BI.

**Availability Analysis**: Investigate availability patterns and occupancy rates and visualize demand fluctuations using Power BI.

**Location-Based Insights**: Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods, enabling users to understand location-based trends with Power BI.

# Skills Developed
Through this project, you will enhance your skills in the following areas:

-Data visualization using Power BI.
-Problem-solving skills for data analysis.
-Project Evaluation Metrics


# Project Workflow
Note: This project is developed for educational purposes and to showcase data analysis and visualization skills. The Airbnb data used is sample data, and all analyses and visualizations are based on this sample data.

The project workflow is structured into the following key steps:


-Data Cleaning and Preparation: Clean and prepare the dataset, addressing issues like missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

-Price Analysis and Visualization: Analyze and visualize pricing variations based on location and property type using Power BI.

-Geo-spatial Visualization: Develope a Streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
Visualized the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices and other relevant factors.

-Dashboard Creation: Created a Dashboard in Power BI. Utilized the power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis.
Combined different visualizations such as maps, tables and charts to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.

-Availability Analysis: Investigate availability patterns and occupancy rates and visualize demand fluctuations using Power BI.

-Location-Based Insights: Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods, enabling users to understand location-based trends with Power BI.
