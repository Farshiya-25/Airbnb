This project aims to analyze the AIRBNB data by performing data cleaning and preparation and to develop interactive geospatial visualizations
and to create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns and location-based trends.

Skills that are used here are:
1) *Python Scripting*
2) *Data preprocessing*
3) *Visualization*
4) *EDA*
5) *Streamlit*
6) *Power BI*

This project is done by the following process:
1)**Data Cleaning And Preparation**: Airbnb dataset is cleaned by handling missing values,removing duplicates and transforming datatypes as necessary.
Prepared the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks.
2)**Geo-spatial Visualization**: Developed a Streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps.
Visualized the distribution of listings across different locations, allowing users to explore prices and other relevant factors.
3)**Interactive Visualizations**: Developed a  dynamic and interactive visualizations that allows users to filter and drill down into the data.
Enabled users to interact with the visualizations.
4)**Dashboard Creation**: Created a Dashboard in Power BI. Utilized the power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis.
Combined different visualizations such as maps, tables and charts to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
